# Difference-in-differences-DID-in-a-training-applied-to-a-sales-team
This repository contains a step-by-step, didactic analysis of a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) model applied to a real-world-inspired scenario: a sales training program applied to only part of a sales team.  The goal is to estimate the causal impact of the training on sales performance using Python and statistical modeling.
